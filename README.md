My portfolio is completely build using jekyll

**Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.**

Earlier used php for dynamic content loading. Check out [Lebenslauf](https://github.com/rajat19/Lebenslauf).

Learn more about jekyll using [official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

If you want to create your profile similar to this. You need to just make changes in [_data](_data/) folder which contains all dynamic generated contents. Try it out !
