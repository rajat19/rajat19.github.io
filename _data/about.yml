quotes:
- 'Credentials are like potential energy, the compliments of a name on paper, in documents, word of mouth, but faith
	is like kinetic energy, the motion and the force that which is witnessed. Hence in the end it is the faith rather
	than the credentials that really takes you places.'
- 'Take the path less traveled and learn from your mistakes. Donâ€™t just let life happen around you; control your future.
	Learn to ask questions, set small goals, and dream of big ones. Absorb any criticism and let it fuel you. Convince
	others that you are worthy of your dream, and show them that you are willing to put up a damn good fight for it.'
